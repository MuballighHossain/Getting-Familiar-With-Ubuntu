# Getting-Familiar-With-Ubuntu

Complete the following Tasks:

1. Write down some different kinds of cloud computing applications that are not in google. Most important, don't discuss anything with your friend. Write by yourself. If I get a single word match with your friend, then the marks will be entirely zero.

2. Install Ubuntu in dual boot mode/ vmware/virtualbox. You need a bootable pendrive for this. Search google how to set up ubuntu in dual boot mode.

Your username should be <firstname>

And host-name should be <lastname-studentid>

You must follow this convention, without this convention I will not give you any marks in the assignments.

For example, the student's name is Mofiz Uddin, and id is 12345678.

So, your terminal should look mofiz@uddin-12345678. First part username is mofiz and 2nd part hostname/pc name is uddin-12345678

Start learning some basic commands in Ubuntu, try to get familiar with Ubuntu terminal, run every basic command. You can use the link below and make a document. That will be your first assignment.

Be Careful when writing assignments. For every command you need to write at first the description of the commands, that is what the commands are done actually. After, just add the output of the screenshot.
